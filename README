Puppet::Body is a utility class that is used (and not inherited like
the deprecated Puppet::Any) to manage dynamic has-a relations between
objects.

This class provides the following features :

- An event log display so derived object may log their activity
- A Debug log display so derived object may log their "accidental" 
  activities
- A set of functions to managed "has-a" relationship between Puppet objects.
- A facility to store data on a database file tied to a hash.


About Puppet body classes

Puppet classes are a set of utility classes which can be used by any
object.  If you use directly the Puppet::Body class, you get the plain
functionnality.  And if you use the Puppet::Show class, you can get
the same functionnality and a Tk Gui to manage it.


I'd like people who use this module for their application to drop me a
short note about what they're using this module for.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
